# SixStones

## What is it?
SixStones is a Minecraft Java server plugin. It has "stones" that players will collect. These stones will grant the player different effects. For example, the buff: "Dazzling Diamond" will grant Health Boost 3 (5 hearts). Players will work together to collect all six of the stones to try to end the server. The goal of this plugin is literally: to end the server.

## Download

THE ONLY TWO PLACES YOU CAN GET THIS PLUGIN IS THIS GITHUB AND MODRINTH.

### Github Releases/Modrinth

This plugin **should** work for both Spigot (untested) and Paper (tested) servers.

1. Download the ```.jar``` file corresponding to the version of server you're running.
2. Drag the ```.jar``` file to the plugins folder where you installed the server
3. Just run the server :) (there is no configs because I was making this for a specific server)

### Self-Build or whatever

I don't really recommend doing this, but have fun!
I used Maven to build the .jar file

1. ```git clone``` this repository
2. Use maven to build and drag to plugins folder. (why am i even writing this)

If you know how to use maven, then you should be able to drag the file to plugins :D

## Permissions

There's not really any permissions for commands, but:

```/giveallstones``` requires the permission: ```sixstones.giveallstones```
```/stone <stone> drop``` requires the permission: ```sixstones.drop```
```/stone <stone> recover``` requires the permission: ```sixstones.recover```
